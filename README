This is ftserver, the Flickr Transform server.

INSTALLATION

It should be enough to run:

1. git clone https://github.com/reutenauer/ftserver.git
2. Copy your Flickr API keys to config/flickr-keys.json in the format defined there.
3. Run bundle install
4. Start the server with bundle exec ruby -Iapp start-server

The service is then available on http://localhost:48067/
